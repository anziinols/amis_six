### app/Controllers/ActivitiesController.php
**Removed:**
- Line 15: Import statement `use App\Models\PerformanceOutputsModel;`
- Line 37: Property declaration `protected $performanceOutputsModel;`
- Line 60: Model initialization `$this->performanceOutputsModel = new PerformanceOutputsModel();`
- Lines 1794-1805: Method `getPerformanceOutputs($workplanPeriodId)` - AJAX endpoint

### app/Controllers/WorkplanPeriodController.php
**Removed:**
- Lines 8-11: Import statements for `PerformanceOutputsModel`, `DutyInstructionItemsModel`, `WorkplanActivityModel`, `OutputDutyInstructionModel`, `OutputWorkplanActivitiesModel`
- Lines 22-26: Property declarations for all the above models
- Lines 32-36: Model initializations for all the above models

- Lines 273-303: Method `manageOutputLinks($workplanPeriodId, $outputId)` - Manage output links
- Lines 308-330: Method `linkToDutyInstruction($workplanPeriodId, $outputId)` - Link output to duty instruction
- Lines 335-357: Method `linkToWorkplanActivity($workplanPeriodId, $outputId)` - Link output to workplan activity
- Lines 362-376: Method `removeDutyInstructionLink($workplanPeriodId, $outputId, $linkId)` - Remove duty instruction link
- Lines 381-395: Method `removeWorkplanActivityLink($workplanPeriodId, $outputId, $linkId)` - Remove workplan activity link

### app/Views/performance_indicators_kra/performance_indicators_kra_index_indicators.php
**Removed:**
- Lines 76-78: Button to view performance outputs for each indicator

### app/Views/performance_indicators_kra/performance_indicators_kra_show.php
**Removed:**
- Lines 20-22: Button to view performance outputs (for performance indicators)

### app/Views/workplan_period/workplan_period_outputs.php
**Removed:**
- Lines 133-135: "View" button linking to performance output details
- Lines 139-141: "Edit" button linking to performance output edit form

## Database Changes

### Tables to Drop
- `performance_outputs` - Main table storing performance output data
- `output_duty_instruction` - Junction table linking outputs to duty instructions
- `output_workplan_activities` - Junction table linking outputs to workplan activities

**SQL Script Created:**
- `database_cleanup_performance_outputs.sql` - Contains the DROP TABLE statements for all three tables

**PHP Script Available:**
- `drop_performance_output_tables.php` - CodeIgniter script to drop all three tables

**To execute the database cleanup:**

**Option 1: Using the PHP script (Recommended for CodeIgniter)**
```bash
# Navigate to your project root
cd c:/xampp/htdocs/amis_six

# Run the PHP script
php drop_performance_output_tables.php
```

**Option 2: Using MySQL command line**
```bash
mysql -u your_username -p your_database_name < database_cleanup_performance_outputs.sql
```

**Option 3: Using phpMyAdmin**
1. Open phpMyAdmin
2. Select your database
3. Go to SQL tab
4. Copy and paste the contents of database_cleanup_performance_outputs.sql
5. Click "Go"

## Impact Analysis

### Features Affected
1. **Performance Indicators** - Can no longer create/view/edit outputs for indicators
2. **Workplan Periods** - Removed ability to view and manage outputs
3. **Activities** - Removed AJAX endpoint for loading performance outputs

### Features NOT Affected
1. **Performance Indicators KRA** - Still functional (create, edit, delete KRAs and indicators)
2. **Workplan Activities** - Not affected
3. **Duty Instructions** - Not affected
4. **Other reporting features** - Not affected

## Testing Recommendations

After applying these changes, test the following:

1. **Performance Indicators KRA**
   - Navigate to performance indicators list
   - Verify no "View Performance Outputs" button appears
   - Create, edit, and delete indicators to ensure functionality

2. **Workplan Periods**
   - View workplan period details
   - Verify outputs-related routes return 404 errors
   - Ensure other workplan period features work correctly

3. **Activities**
   - Create and edit activities
   - Verify no errors related to performance outputs

4. **Database**
   - After running the SQL script, verify the `performance_outputs` table is removed
   - Check that no foreign key constraints are broken

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to restore this feature:

1. Restore the deleted files from version control
2. Restore the code modifications in Routes.php, ActivitiesController.php, and WorkplanPeriodController.php
3. Restore the view modifications
4. Recreate the `performance_outputs` table using the migration file at:
   `app/Database/Migrations/2025-01-20-000002_CreateWorkplanTables.php` (lines 189-268)

## Notes

- The `performance_outputs` folder in `app/Views/` can be manually deleted if it still exists (should be empty after file removal)
- No migration file was created to drop the table (as per project rules)
- The SQL script must be run manually to complete the database cleanup
- Make sure to backup your database before running the cleanup script
