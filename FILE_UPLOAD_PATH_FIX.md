# File Upload Path Fix - Application-Wide

## Overview
This document details the comprehensive fix applied to file upload handling across the AMIS application. The issue was that files were being saved to incorrect directories (using `WRITEPATH` or `FCPATH`) and database paths were missing the `public/` prefix, causing files to be inaccessible when the application tried to display them.

## Problem Statement

### Original Issue:
When files were uploaded (user photos, documents, duty instructions, etc.), they were being:
1. **Saved to wrong location**: `WRITEPATH . 'uploads/...'` (writable directory) instead of `public/uploads/...`
2. **Stored with incomplete path**: Database stored `'uploads/folder/file.jpg'` instead of `'public/uploads/folder/file.jpg'`
3. **Inaccessible via URL**: Files couldn't be accessed via `base_url()` because they weren't in the public directory

### Root Cause:
- Inconsistent use of `WRITEPATH`, `FCPATH`, and `ROOTPATH` constants
- Missing `public/` prefix when storing file paths in database
- Files stored in `writable/uploads/` instead of `public/uploads/`

## Solution Applied

### Standard Pattern Implemented:
```php
// Create directory if it doesn't exist
$uploadPath = ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/{folder_name}/';
if (!is_dir($uploadPath)) {
    mkdir($uploadPath, 0755, true);
}

$newName = $file->getRandomName();
$file->move($uploadPath, $newName);

// Store path with public/ prefix for correct URL construction
$data['file_path_field'] = 'public/uploads/{folder_name}/' . $newName;
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Upload Location**: Changed from `WRITEPATH . 'uploads/'` to `ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/'`
2. **Database Path**: Always store with `public/` prefix: `'public/uploads/folder/file.jpg'`
3. **Directory Creation**: Added automatic directory creation with proper permissions (0755)
4. **Consistency**: Applied same pattern across all file upload operations

## Files Modified

### 1. ✅ `app/Controllers/Admin/UsersController.php`

**Issue Fixed**: User ID photo uploads in both `store()` and `update()` methods

**Lines Modified**:
- **store() method** (Lines 165-178): User creation photo upload
- **update() method** (Lines 310-326): User update photo upload

**Before**:
```php
$file->move(WRITEPATH . 'uploads/user_photos/', $newName);
$userData['id_photo_filepath'] = 'uploads/user_photos/' . $newName;
```

**After**:
```php
$uploadPath = ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/user_photos/';
if (!is_dir($uploadPath)) {
    mkdir($uploadPath, 0755, true);
}
$file->move($uploadPath, $newName);
$userData['id_photo_filepath'] = 'public/uploads/user_photos/' . $newName;
```

**Impact**: User profile photos now correctly saved and accessible

### 2. ✅ `app/Controllers/DutyInstructionsController.php`

**Issue Fixed**: Duty instruction file uploads in both `store()` and `update()` methods

**Lines Modified**:
- **store() method** (Lines 88-101): New duty instruction file upload
- **update() method** (Lines 188-201): Update duty instruction file upload

**Before**:
```php
$file->move(WRITEPATH . 'uploads/duty_instructions/', $newName);
$data['duty_instruction_filepath'] = 'uploads/duty_instructions/' . $newName;
```

**After**:
```php
$uploadPath = ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/duty_instructions/';
if (!is_dir($uploadPath)) {
    mkdir($uploadPath, 0755, true);
}
$file->move($uploadPath, $newName);
$data['duty_instruction_filepath'] = 'public/uploads/duty_instructions/' . $newName;
```

**Impact**: Duty instruction files now correctly saved and accessible

---

### 3. ✅ `app/Controllers/ActivitiesController.php`

**Issue Fixed**: Document file uploads in supervised activities

**Lines Modified**:
- **saveSupervised() method** (Lines 2528-2550): Document uploads

**Before**:
```php
$file->move(WRITEPATH . '../public/uploads/documents', $newName);
$documentsData[] = [
    'file_path' => 'public/uploads/documents/' . $newName,
    // ...
];
```

**After**:
```php
$uploadPath = ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/documents/';
if (!is_dir($uploadPath)) {
    mkdir($uploadPath, 0755, true);
}
$file->move($uploadPath, $newName);
$documentsData[] = [
    'file_path' => 'public/uploads/documents/' . $newName,
    // ...
];
```

**Impact**: Activity documents now correctly saved and accessible

---

### 4. ✅ `app/Controllers/Admin/CommoditiesController.php`

**Issue Fixed**: Commodity icon uploads in both `store()` and `update()` methods

**Lines Modified**:
- **store() method** (Lines 76-93): New commodity icon upload
- **update() method** (Lines 202-224): Update commodity icon upload

**Before**:
```php
$uploadPath = FCPATH . 'uploads/commodities/icons/';
// ...
if (!empty($commodity['commodity_icon']) && file_exists(FCPATH . $commodity['commodity_icon'])) {
    unlink(FCPATH . $commodity['commodity_icon']);
}
```

**After**:
```php
$uploadPath = ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/commodities/icons/';
// ...
if (!empty($commodity['commodity_icon']) && file_exists(ROOTPATH . $commodity['commodity_icon'])) {
    unlink(ROOTPATH . $commodity['commodity_icon']);
}
```

**Impact**: Commodity icons now correctly saved and accessible

## Files Already Correct (No Changes Needed)

The following controllers were already using the correct pattern:

### ✅ `app/Controllers/WorkplanOutputActivitiesController.php`
- **Method**: `handleSingleFileUpload()` (Lines 386-405)
- **Status**: Already using `ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/'` and storing with `public/` prefix
- **No changes needed**

### ✅ `app/Controllers/SmeController.php`
- **Methods**: `staff_store()` and `staff_update()`
- **Status**: Already using `'public/uploads/sme_staff_photos'` correctly
- **No changes needed**

### ✅ `app/Controllers/DashboardController.php`
- **Method**: `updateProfilePhoto()` (Lines 204-273)
- **Status**: Already using correct path and storing with `public/` prefix
- **No changes needed**

### ✅ `app/Controllers/ActivitiesController.php` (Other Methods)
The following methods in ActivitiesController were already correct:
- Training images upload (Lines 1159-1179)
- Training files upload (Lines 1203-1218)
- Input images upload (Lines 1316-1331)
- Input files upload (Lines 1334-1355)
- Output files upload (Lines 1688-1711)

All these already use `ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/'` and store paths with `public/` prefix.

## Directory Structure

After these fixes, all uploaded files are stored in the following structure:

```
public/
└── uploads/
    ├── user_photos/           # User ID photos
    ├── profile/               # User profile photos
    ├── duty_instructions/     # Duty instruction files
    ├── documents/             # Activity documents
    ├── commodities/
    │   └── icons/            # Commodity icons
    ├── sme_staff_photos/     # SME staff photos
    ├── training/             # Training images
    ├── training_files/       # Training files
    ├── input_images/         # Input activity images
    ├── input_files/          # Input activity files
    └── output_files/         # Output activity files
```

---

## Database Path Format

All file paths stored in the database now follow this format:
```
public/uploads/{folder_name}/{filename}
```

Examples:
- `public/uploads/user_photos/1738234567_abc123.jpg`
- `public/uploads/duty_instructions/1738234567_def456.pdf`
- `public/uploads/documents/1738234567_ghi789.docx`

---

## URL Construction

Files can now be accessed using:
```php
base_url($filePath)
```

Where `$filePath` is the value from the database (e.g., `public/uploads/user_photos/file.jpg`)

This will generate URLs like:
```
http://localhost/amis_six/public/uploads/user_photos/file.jpg
```

## Testing Checklist

### Test User Photo Upload:
- [ ] Create new user with ID photo at `/admin/users/create`
- [ ] Verify file is saved to `public/uploads/user_photos/`
- [ ] Check database - `id_photo_filepath` should start with `public/`
- [ ] View user profile - photo should display correctly
- [ ] Update user with new photo
- [ ] Verify old photo is replaced and new photo displays

### Test Duty Instruction Upload:
- [ ] Create new duty instruction with file at `/duty-instructions/create`
- [ ] Verify file is saved to `public/uploads/duty_instructions/`
- [ ] Check database - `duty_instruction_filepath` should start with `public/`
- [ ] View duty instruction - file should be downloadable
- [ ] Update duty instruction with new file
- [ ] Verify file is accessible

### Test Activity Document Upload:
- [ ] Create supervised activity with documents
- [ ] Verify files are saved to `public/uploads/documents/`
- [ ] Check database - file paths should start with `public/`
- [ ] View activity - documents should be downloadable

### Test Commodity Icon Upload:
- [ ] Create new commodity with icon at `/admin/commodities/create`
- [ ] Verify file is saved to `public/uploads/commodities/icons/`
- [ ] Check database - `commodity_icon` should start with `public/`
- [ ] View commodity list - icon should display
- [ ] Update commodity with new icon
- [ ] Verify old icon is deleted and new icon displays

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Files:
If you have existing files in the wrong location (`writable/uploads/`), you need to:

1. **Move files** from `writable/uploads/` to `public/uploads/`
2. **Update database** to add `public/` prefix to existing file paths

**SQL to update existing records**:
```sql
-- Update user photos
UPDATE users 
SET id_photo_filepath = CONCAT('public/', id_photo_filepath) 
WHERE id_photo_filepath IS NOT NULL 
AND id_photo_filepath NOT LIKE 'public/%';

-- Update duty instructions
UPDATE duty_instructions 
SET duty_instruction_filepath = CONCAT('public/', duty_instruction_filepath) 
WHERE duty_instruction_filepath IS NOT NULL 
AND duty_instruction_filepath NOT LIKE 'public/%';

-- Update commodities
UPDATE commodities 
SET commodity_icon = CONCAT('public/', commodity_icon) 
WHERE commodity_icon IS NOT NULL 
AND commodity_icon NOT LIKE 'public/%';
```

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Directory Permissions**: All directories created with `0755` permissions
2. **File Validation**: Existing validation for file types and sizes maintained
3. **Public Access**: Files in `public/uploads/` are web-accessible (intended behavior)
4. **Sensitive Files**: If any files should NOT be publicly accessible, they should remain in `writable/` directory

---

## Constants Reference

- **ROOTPATH**: Project root directory (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/amis_six/`)
- **FCPATH**: Front controller path (public directory) - `C:/xampp/htdocs/amis_six/public/`
- **WRITEPATH**: Writable directory for logs, cache, sessions - `C:/xampp/htdocs/amis_six/writable/`

**Correct Usage**:
- For public uploads: `ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/'`
- For logs/cache: `WRITEPATH . 'logs/'` or `WRITEPATH . 'cache/'`

---

## Summary

✅ **4 Controllers Fixed**:
1. UsersController (2 methods)
2. DutyInstructionsController (2 methods)
3. ActivitiesController (1 method)
4. CommoditiesController (2 methods)

✅ **Total Methods Fixed**: 7 file upload methods

✅ **Pattern Applied**: Consistent use of `ROOTPATH . 'public/uploads/'` and `public/` prefix in database
