# Duty Instruction Feature - Universal Access Update

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Activity Links "Manage Links" Button Hidden
The "Manage Links" button for the duty instruction feature at `/activities/{id}/links` was only visible to admin users and action officers, even though the backend controller methods had no authorization restrictions.

### Issue 2: Duty Instructions Menu Not Visible to Regular Users
The "Duty Instructions" menu item in the sidebar was only visible to admin and supervisor users, preventing regular users from accessing the duty instructions feature.

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Show "Manage Links" Button to All Users
Removed the conditional check that was hiding the "Manage Links" button, making it visible to all authenticated users.

### Solution 2: Add Duty Instructions Menu for All Users
Updated the navigation helper to include 'user' capability for duty instructions menu access.

## Changes Made

### Change 1: Activity Links Button Visibility

#### File: `app/Views/activities/activities_show.php`

**Before (Lines 188-199):**
```php
<!-- Activity Links Section -->
<div class="card mb-4">
    <div class="card-header">
        <h5 class="card-title mb-0">
            <i class="fas fa-link me-2"></i>Activity Links
            <?php if ($canImplement): ?>
            <a href="<?= base_url('activities/' . $activity['id'] . '/links') ?>" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary float-end">
                <i class="fas fa-cog me-1"></i> Manage Links
            </a>
            <?php endif; ?>
        </h5>
    </div>
```

**After (Lines 188-198):**
```php
<!-- Activity Links Section -->
<div class="card mb-4">
    <div class="card-header">
        <h5 class="card-title mb-0">
            <i class="fas fa-link me-2"></i>Activity Links
            <!-- All authenticated users can manage links -->
            <a href="<?= base_url('activities/' . $activity['id'] . '/links') ?>" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary float-end">
                <i class="fas fa-cog me-1"></i> Manage Links
            </a>
        </h5>
    </div>
```

### Change 2: Navigation Menu Access

#### File: `app/Helpers/navigation_helper.php`

**Location 1 - `canAccessMenu()` function (Line 44):**

**Before:**
```php
'duty_instructions' => ['admin', 'supervisor'],
```

**After:**
```php
'duty_instructions' => ['admin', 'supervisor', 'user'], // Allow all users access to duty instructions
```

**Location 2 - `getNavigationMenus()` function (Lines 144-149):**

**Before:**
```php
'duty_instructions' => [
    'title' => 'Duty Instructions',
    'icon' => 'fas fa-tasks',
    'url' => 'duty-instructions',
    'capabilities' => ['admin', 'supervisor']
],
```

**After:**
```php
'duty_instructions' => [
    'title' => 'Duty Instructions',
    'icon' => 'fas fa-tasks',
    'url' => 'duty-instructions',
    'capabilities' => ['admin', 'supervisor', 'user']
],
```

## Access Control Summary

### Backend (Controller)
**File:** `app/Controllers/ActivitiesController.php`

All activity links methods have **NO authorization checks** beyond basic authentication:

1. **`manageLinks($id)`** - Display links management page
   - ✅ Only checks if activity exists
   - ✅ No user role restrictions

2. **`linkToDutyInstruction($id)`** - Create link to duty instruction
   - ✅ Only checks if activity exists
   - ✅ No user role restrictions

3. **`linkToWorkplanActivity($id)`** - Create link to workplan activity
   - ✅ Only checks if activity exists
   - ✅ No user role restrictions

4. **`removeDutyInstructionLink($id)`** - Remove duty instruction link
   - ✅ Only checks if activity exists
   - ✅ No user role restrictions

5. **`removeWorkplanActivityLink($id)`** - Remove workplan activity link
   - ✅ Only checks if activity exists
   - ✅ No user role restrictions

### Frontend (View)
**File:** `app/Views/activities/activities_show.php`

**Before:** "Manage Links" button was only visible when `$canImplement` was true:
- `$canImplement = $isAdmin || $isActionOfficer`
- Only admins and action officers could see the button

**After:** "Manage Links" button is visible to all authenticated users:
- No conditional check
- All users who can view the activity can manage links

### Route Protection
**File:** `app/Config/Routes.php`

All activity routes (including links routes) are protected by the `auth` filter:
```php
$routes->group('activities', ['filter' => 'auth'], function($routes) {
    // ... other routes ...
    $routes->get('(:num)/links', 'ActivitiesController::manageLinks/$1');
    $routes->post('(:num)/link-duty-instruction', 'ActivitiesController::linkToDutyInstruction/$1');
    $routes->post('(:num)/link-workplan-activity', 'ActivitiesController::linkToWorkplanActivity/$1');
    $routes->post('(:num)/remove-duty-instruction-link', 'ActivitiesController::removeDutyInstructionLink/$1');
    $routes->post('(:num)/remove-workplan-activity-link', 'ActivitiesController::removeWorkplanActivityLink/$1');
});
```

This means:
- ✅ Users must be logged in to access these routes
- ✅ No additional role-based restrictions

## Feature Overview

### Duty Instruction Links Feature
Allows users to link activities to duty instruction items, creating a connection between:
- **Activities** (from `activities` table)
- **Duty Instruction Items** (from `duty_instruction_items` table)

### Workplan Activity Links Feature
Allows users to link activities to workplan activities, creating a connection between:
- **Activities** (from `activities` table)
- **Workplan Activities** (from `workplan_activities` table)

### Junction Tables
- `myactivities_duty_instructions` - Links activities to duty instruction items
- `myactivities_workplan_activities` - Links activities to workplan activities

## Duty Instructions Controller Access Control

### File: `app/Controllers/DutyInstructionsController.php`

The `index()` method filters duty instructions based on the logged-in user:

```php
->groupStart()
    ->where('duty_instructions.user_id', $loggedInUserId) // Assigned to this user
    ->orWhere('duty_instructions.supervisor_id', $loggedInUserId) // OR user is supervisor
->groupEnd()
```

This means:
- Users see duty instructions where they are assigned as the user
- Users see duty instructions where they are assigned as the supervisor
- Users do NOT see duty instructions they are not involved with

## User Experience

2. Admin users and action officers could:
   - ✅ Access `/activities/{id}/links` via URL

## Summary of Changes

### What Was Changed
1. ✅ **Navigation Helper** - Added 'user' capability to duty_instructions menu access (2 locations)
2. ✅ **Activity Show View** - Removed conditional check for "Manage Links" button visibility

### What Was NOT Changed
- ❌ Backend controller authorization (already allowed all authenticated users)
- ❌ Route filters (already using 'auth' filter only)
- ❌ Data filtering logic (duty instructions still filtered by user assignment)

### Impact
- **Positive:** All users can now see and access the duty instructions feature via the sidebar menu
- **Positive:** All users can now see the "Manage Links" button in activity details
- **No Security Impact:** Backend access control remains unchanged - users still only see their assigned duty instructions
- **No Breaking Changes:** Existing functionality for admin and supervisor users remains the same

## Notes

- The backend controller methods never had authorization restrictions beyond authentication
- The issues were purely frontend visibility problems
- All authenticated users now have equal access to:
  - The duty instructions menu in the sidebar
  - The "Manage Links" button in activity details
  - The duty instruction linking feature
- Users still only see duty instructions where they are assigned as user or supervisor
- This aligns with the requirement that "all users should have access to duty instruction feature"
