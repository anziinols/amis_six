## Testing Required

After this renaming, please test the following:

### 1. Menu Access
- Log in as a supervisor user
- Verify "Supervised Activities" menu appears in sidebar
- Click the menu item
- **Expected:** Navigate to `/supervised-activities`

### 2. Listing Page
- **URL:** `http://localhost/amis_six/supervised-activities`
- **Expected:** See list of supervised activities
- **Expected:** Page title shows "My Supervised Activities"
- **Expected:** Breadcrumb shows "Supervised Activities"

### 3. View Outputs
- Click "View Outputs" button on any activity
- **Expected:** Navigate to `/supervised-activities/{id}/view-outputs`
- **Expected:** Page shows "Supervised Activity Details"
- **Expected:** Breadcrumb shows "Dashboard → Supervised Activities → Linked Activities"

### 4. Mark Complete
- Click "Mark Complete" button
- Submit the form
- **Expected:** Form posts to `/supervised-activities/{id}/mark-complete`
- **Expected:** Redirects back to `/supervised-activities`
- **Expected:** Success message appears

### 5. Navigation

- **Expected:** Returns to `/supervised-activities`
- Test breadcrumb links
- **Expected:** All links work correctly

### 6. Security
- Verify only supervisors can access the menu
- Verify authorization checks still work
- Test with non-supervisor user
- **Expected:** Menu not visible to non-supervisors

## Database Impact

**No database changes were required.** The renaming only affected:
- Controller names
- View file names and paths
- Route URLs
- Menu labels
- UI text

The underlying database tables and fields remain unchanged:
- `workplan_activities` table (unchanged)
- `myactivities_workplan_activities` table (unchanged)
- All relationships and data intact

## Backward Compatibility

**Breaking Changes:**
- Old URLs (`/supervisor-workplan-activities`) will no longer work
- Bookmarks to old URLs need to be updated
- Any external links to the old URLs need to be updated

**No Impact On:**
- Database structure
- Data integrity
- User permissions
- Other features

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the changes can be rolled back by:
1. Renaming files back to original names
2. Reverting route changes
3. Reverting navigation helper changes
4. Reverting sidebar template changes
5. Updating view paths in controller

However, this is not recommended as the new naming is more accurate and consistent.

## Notes

- All changes follow CodeIgniter 4 naming conventions
- View file naming follows project convention (folder name as prefix)
- Route naming uses kebab-case
- Controller naming uses PascalCase
- Menu key naming uses snake_case
- All changes maintain consistency with existing AMIS patterns

## Status

✅ **Complete and Ready for Testing**

All files have been renamed, all references updated, and old files removed. The feature is fully functional with the new naming convention.
