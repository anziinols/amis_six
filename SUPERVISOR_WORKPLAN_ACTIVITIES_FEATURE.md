# Supervised Activities Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the new "Supervised Activities" feature for supervisor users in the AMIS application.

## Feature Description
Supervisors can now view and manage their assigned supervised activities through a dedicated interface. They can see all activities assigned to them and mark them as complete when finished.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Controller
**File:** `app/Controllers/SupervisorWorkplanActivitiesController.php`
- **Methods:**
  - `index()` - Displays list of workplan activities assigned to the current supervisor
  - `markComplete($id)` - Marks an activity as complete

### 2. View
**File:** `app/Views/supervisor_workplan_activities/supervisor_workplan_activities_index.php`
- Displays activities in a responsive DataTable
- Shows activity details: code, title, workplan, branch, target output, budget, status
- Includes "Mark Complete" button for pending activities
- Modal dialog for confirming completion with optional remarks

### 3. Navigation Helper
**File:** `app/Helpers/navigation_helper.php`
- Added `'supervisor_workplan_activities' => ['supervisor']` to menu capabilities

### 4. Sidebar Template
**File:** `app/Views/templates/system_template.php`
- Added "Workplan Activities" menu item for supervisors
- Menu appears between "Workplans" and "Evaluation" menus
- Only visible to users with supervisor capability

### 5. Routes
**File:** `app/Config/Routes.php`
- Added route group for supervisor workplan activities:
  - `GET /supervisor-workplan-activities` - List activities
  - `POST /supervisor-workplan-activities/{id}/mark-complete` - Mark activity complete

## Database Fields Used

The feature uses the existing `workplan_activities` table with these fields:
- `id` - Activity ID
- `supervisor_id` - Links activity to supervisor user
- `workplan_id` - Links to workplan
- `branch_id` - Links to branch
- `activity_code` - Unique activity code
- `title` - Activity title
- `description` - Activity description
- `target_output` - Target output
- `total_budget` - Budget amount
- `status` - Activity status ('complete' or other values)
- `status_by` - User who changed status
- `status_at` - Timestamp of status change
- `status_remarks` - Remarks about status change

## Access Control

**Who can access:**
- Users with `is_supervisor = 1` capability

**How it works:**
- The `canAccessMenu()` helper function checks if user has supervisor capability
- Only activities where `supervisor_id` matches the current user's ID are displayed
- Users can only mark complete activities assigned to them

## Features Implemented

### 1. Activity Listing
- ✅ Displays all activities assigned to the logged-in supervisor
- ✅ Shows activity code, title, workplan, branch, target output, budget
- ✅ Displays current status (Complete/Pending)
- ✅ Responsive DataTable with search, sort, and pagination
- ✅ Shows completion date for completed activities

### 2. Mark Complete Functionality
- ✅ "Mark Complete" button for pending activities
- ✅ Modal confirmation dialog
- ✅ Optional remarks field
- ✅ Updates status to 'complete'
- ✅ Records who marked it complete and when
- ✅ Standard CodeIgniter 4 form submission (not AJAX)
- ✅ Redirects back to listing with success message
- ✅ Completed activities show "Completed" label instead of button

### 3. Security
- ✅ Verifies user is logged in
- ✅ Verifies user is the assigned supervisor before allowing updates
- ✅ Prevents marking already completed activities
- ✅ CSRF protection enabled

## Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have a user account with `is_supervisor = 1` in the database
2. Ensure there are workplan activities in the database with `supervisor_id` matching your user ID
3. Base URL: http://localhost/amis_six/dashboard

### Test Steps

#### Test 1: Access the Feature
1. Log in as a supervisor user
2. Look for "Workplan Activities" menu item in the sidebar
3. Click on "Workplan Activities"
4. **Expected:** You should see a list of activities assigned to you

#### Test 2: View Activities List
1. Navigate to the Workplan Activities page
2. **Expected:** 
   - Activities are displayed in a table
   - Each activity shows: code, title, workplan, branch, target output, budget, status
   - Pending activities show "Mark Complete" button
   - Completed activities show "Completed" label with date

#### Test 3: Mark Activity as Complete
1. Find a pending activity in the list
2. Click the "Mark Complete" button
3. **Expected:** Modal dialog appears asking for confirmation
4. Optionally enter remarks in the text area
5. Click "Mark as Complete" button
6. **Expected:** 
   - Page redirects back to the listing
   - Success message appears
   - Activity status changes to "Complete"
   - "Mark Complete" button is replaced with "Completed" label

#### Test 4: Security Checks
1. Try to access the page without logging in
2. **Expected:** Redirected to login page
3. Try to mark complete an activity not assigned to you (modify URL manually)
4. **Expected:** Error message "You are not authorized to update this activity"

#### Test 5: DataTable Features
1. Use the search box to filter activities
2. Click column headers to sort
3. Change the number of entries displayed
4. **Expected:** All DataTable features work correctly

### Sample Test Data

If you need to create test data, you can use this SQL:

```sql
-- Ensure you have a supervisor user
UPDATE users SET is_supervisor = 1 WHERE id = YOUR_USER_ID;

-- Create a test workplan activity
INSERT INTO workplan_activities (
    workplan_id, 
    supervisor_id, 
    title, 
    description, 
    target_output, 
    total_budget, 
    status,
    created_at,
    updated_at
) VALUES (
    1, -- Replace with valid workplan_id
    YOUR_USER_ID, -- Replace with your user ID
    'Test Activity for Supervisor',
    'This is a test activity to verify the supervisor workplan activities feature',
    'Complete testing',
    5000.00,
    NULL, -- Pending status
    NOW(),
    NOW()
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Menu Item Not Showing
- Check that your user has `is_supervisor = 1` in the database
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### No Activities Displayed
- Verify there are activities in `workplan_activities` table with your user ID in `supervisor_id` field
- Check that activities are not soft-deleted (`deleted_at IS NULL`)

### Mark Complete Not Working
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify CSRF token is present in the form
- Check server logs for PHP errors

## Technical Notes

### CodeIgniter 4 Patterns Used
- RESTful controller methods
- Standard form submission (not AJAX)
- Model-based database operations
- Session-based authentication
- Flash messages for user feedback
- CSRF protection

### Naming Conventions
- Controller: `SupervisorWorkplanActivitiesController`
- View folder: `supervisor_workplan_activities`
- View file: `supervisor_workplan_activities_index.php`
- Route prefix: `supervisor-workplan-activities`

### Dependencies
- Bootstrap 5 (for UI components)
- DataTables (for table features)
- Font Awesome (for icons)
- jQuery (for DataTables and modal)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential features that could be added later:
- View activity details page
- Edit activity information
- Add comments/notes to activities
- Filter activities by status, workplan, or date range
- Export activities to PDF/Excel
- Email notifications when activities are marked complete
- Activity progress tracking (percentage complete)
