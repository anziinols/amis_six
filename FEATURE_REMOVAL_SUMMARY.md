## What Was Removed

### Database Tables
✅ Dropped tables:
- `duty_instructions_corporate_plan_link`
- `performance_indicators_kra`
- `workplan_period`

### Models
✅ Deleted files:
- `app/Models/DutyInstructionsCorporatePlanLinkModel.php`
- `app/Models/PerformanceIndicatorsKraModel.php`
- `app/Models/WorkplanPeriodModel.php`

### Controllers
✅ Deleted files:
- `app/Controllers/PerformanceIndicatorsKraController.php`
- `app/Controllers/WorkplanPeriodController.php`

### Views
✅ Deleted directories:
- `app/Views/workplan_period/` (6 files)
- `app/Views/performance_indicators_kra/` (6 files)

### Routes
✅ Removed route groups from `app/Config/Routes.php`:
- `workplan-period` routes (12 routes)
- `performance-output` routes (6 routes)
- `performance-indicators-kra` routes (4 routes)

### Navigation
✅ Removed from `app/Helpers/navigation_helper.php`:
- `workplan_period` menu capability
- `workplan_period` menu item

✅ Removed from `app/Views/templates/system_template.php`:
- Workplan Period menu item

### Controller References
✅ Cleaned up `app/Controllers/ActivitiesController.php`:
- Removed `use App\Models\WorkplanPeriodModel;`
- Removed `protected $workplanPeriodModel;` property
- Removed `$this->workplanPeriodModel = new WorkplanPeriodModel();` initialization

## Remaining References

Some legacy references remain in the following files but are inactive:
- Database migration files (historical records)
- Activity view files (commented or unused code)
- These can be cleaned up in a future code cleanup task if needed

## SQL Scripts Created

For reference, the following SQL scripts were created:
- `drop_duty_performance_tables.sql` - Script to drop the removed tables

## Impact

- The system no longer supports:
  - Workplan period-based performance tracking
  - KRA and performance indicator management
  - Corporate plan linking from duty instructions

- Users will need to use alternative methods for:
  - Activity tracking via Activities module
  - Performance evaluation via Evaluation module
  - Strategic planning via existing MTDP, NASP, and Corporate Plan modules

## Notes

- All data in these tables has been permanently removed
- Controllers and models are completely deleted
- Routes are no longer accessible
- Menu items removed from navigation
- This is a clean removal with no backward compatibility
