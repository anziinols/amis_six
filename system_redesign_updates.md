Okay, I understand you want to integrate a new "workplan" functionality into your existing application. This is a significant set of changes, so let's break it down.

To start, I need to understand the current structure of your application. I'll begin by listing the contents of your project's root directory. This will give me an overview of the main components and help me determine where the new workplan features will fit best.


Ran tool
Okay, it looks like this is a PHP application, likely using a framework given the `composer.json`, `vendor` directory, and `public` directory. The `app` directory is probably where most of the application logic resides.

To understand how the new workplan functionality will integrate, I need to look into the `app` directory. I'll list its contents to see how the application is structured.


Ran tool
This confirms it's likely an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, probably CodeIgniter given the directory names (`Models`, `Views`, `Controllers`, `Config`, `Database`, etc.).

Now, let's start thinking about the specific changes you've requested.

**1. User Table Updates:**

You want to add `supervisor` (yes/no), `evaluator` (m&e - yes/no), and `reports_to` (user ID) fields to the `users` table. The roles will be `admin`, `user`, and `guest`.

To understand how to best implement this, I need to see the current structure of the `users` table and how user roles are handled. I'll search for a file that might define the user model or database migration for users.


Ran tool
Okay, the semantic search didn't immediately find a specific user model or migration file. This could mean the table definition is in a different location, or perhaps it's directly in the database schema without a corresponding migration file in the typical `app/Database/Migrations` path if the project isn't strictly following framework conventions for migrations.

Let's try a broader search for files that might contain the `users` table definition or user-related logic. I'll look for files named `User.php` or `UserModel.php` within the `app` directory.


Ran tool
Okay, `app/Models/UserModel.php` looks like the most promising file for the user model. I'll read this file to understand the current user schema and how roles are managed.


Read file: app/Models/UserModel.php
This `UserModel.php` is very helpful! Here's what I've gathered and how it relates to your request:

*   **Table Name:** The model uses the `users` table (`protected $table = 'users';`).
*   **Allowed Fields:** The `allowedFields` array shows the current columns. We'll need to add your new fields here.
*   **`reports_to`:** There's already a `report_to_id` field. This seems to match your `reports_to(reports to user)` requirement. We should confirm if this existing field serves the exact purpose you intend.
*   **Roles:** The `role` field already exists, and the validation rule `in_list[admin,supervisor,user,guest]` shows that `'supervisor'` is already a possible role.
    *   Your request: "the roles are gonna be, admin, user, guest (no supervisor as supervisor will be in the above mentioned)"
    *   This means we need to:
        *   Add the new boolean fields `is_supervisor` and `is_evaluator`.
        *   Potentially remove `'supervisor'` from the allowed `role` enum if `is_supervisor` field will definitively mark a user as a supervisor. Or, we can keep it if a user can have a 'supervisor' role *and* also be marked by the boolean `is_supervisor` for a different kind of supervisory capacity (e.g., project supervisor vs. line manager). Let's clarify this.
*   **Validation:** The model includes validation rules (`$validationRules`) and messages. We'll need to add rules for the new fields.

**Proposed Changes to `UserModel.php`:**

Based on your request and the existing model, here's how we can update `UserModel.php`:

```php:app/Models/UserModel.php
// ... existing code ...
class UserModel extends Model
{
    // Table configuration
    protected $table = 'users';
    protected $primaryKey = 'id';
    protected $useAutoIncrement = true;
    protected $returnType = 'array';
    
    // Use timestamps and specify the fields
    protected $useTimestamps = true;
    protected $createdField = 'created_at';
    protected $updatedField = 'updated_at';
    
    // Fields that can be set during save, insert, update
    protected $allowedFields = [
        'ucode',
        'password',
        'email',
        'phone',
        'fname',
        'lname',
        'gender',
        'dobirth',
        'place_birth',
        'address',
        'employee_number',
        'branch_id',
        'designation',
        'grade',
        'report_to_id', // This existing field seems to match your 'reports_to'
        'role',
        'is_supervisor', // New field
        'is_evaluator',  // New field
        'joined_date',
        'id_photo_filepath',
        'user_status',
        'user_status_remarks',
        'user_status_at',
        'user_status_by',
        'created_by',
        'updated_by'
    ];

    // Validation rules
    protected $validationRules = [
        'ucode' => 'required|max_length[200]',
        'password' => 'required|min_length[4]',
        'email' => 'required|valid_email|is_unique[users.email,id,{id}]',
        'phone' => 'permit_empty',
        'fname' => 'required|max_length[255]',
        'lname' => 'required|max_length[255]',
        'gender' => 'permit_empty|in_list[male,female]',
        'dobirth' => 'permit_empty|valid_date',
        'place_birth' => 'permit_empty|max_length[255]',
        'address' => 'permit_empty',
        'employee_number' => 'permit_empty|max_length[100]',
        'branch_id' => 'permit_empty|integer',
        'designation' => 'permit_empty|max_length[255]',
        'grade' => 'permit_empty|max_length[100]',
        'report_to_id' => 'permit_empty|integer',
        // Updated role validation: admin, user, guest.
        // 'supervisor' role is removed as per your request if is_supervisor field is used.
        // If 'supervisor' role is still needed alongside is_supervisor, we can keep it.
        'role' => 'required|in_list[admin,user,guest]', 
        'is_supervisor' => 'permit_empty|in_list[0,1]', // Assuming 0 for no, 1 for yes
        'is_evaluator' => 'permit_empty|in_list[0,1]',  // Assuming 0 for no, 1 for yes
        'joined_date' => 'permit_empty|valid_date',
        'id_photo_filepath' => 'permit_empty|max_length[255]',
        'user_status' => 'permit_empty|in_list[1,0]',
        'user_status_remarks' => 'permit_empty',
        'user_status_at' => 'permit_empty|valid_date[Y-m-d H:i:s]',
        'user_status_by' => 'permit_empty|integer',
        'created_by' => 'permit_empty|integer',
        'updated_by' => 'permit_empty|integer'
    ];

    // Validation messages
    protected $validationMessages = [
        'ucode' => [
            'required' => 'User code is required',
            'max_length' => 'User code cannot exceed 200 characters'
        ],
        'email' => [
            'required' => 'Email address is required',
            'valid_email' => 'Please enter a valid email address',
            'is_unique' => 'This email is already registered'
        ],
        'fname' => [
            'required' => 'First name is required',
            'max_length' => 'First name cannot exceed 255 characters'
        ],
        'lname' => [
            'required' => 'Last name is required',
            'max_length' => 'Last name cannot exceed 255 characters'
        ],
        'role' => [
            'required' => 'User role is required',
            // Updated message if 'supervisor' role is removed
            'in_list' => 'Invalid role selected. Allowed roles are admin, user, guest.' 
        ],
        'is_supervisor' => [
            'in_list' => 'Invalid value for supervisor status. Must be 0 or 1.'
        ],
        'is_evaluator' => [
            'in_list' => 'Invalid value for evaluator status. Must be 0 or 1.'
        ]
    ];

// ... existing code ...
}
```

**Database Migration:**

You'll also need a database migration to add these new columns (`is_supervisor`, `is_evaluator`) to your `users` table. The exact syntax will depend on your database and how migrations are handled in this CodeIgniter version (e.g., using `dbforge`).

Here's a conceptual example of what the SQL might look like:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN is_supervisor BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN is_evaluator BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

-- If you decide to change the 'role' enum type in the database (e.g., if it's a MySQL ENUM)
-- you might need a more complex migration step, for example:
-- ALTER TABLE users MODIFY role ENUM('admin', 'user', 'guest') NOT NULL;
-- Or, if it's just a VARCHAR, the model validation change is sufficient.
```

**Clarification Needed:**

*   **`report_to_id` vs. your `reports_to`:** Is the existing `report_to_id` field in `UserModel.php` sufficient for your "reports_to" requirement for the user hierarchy?
*   **`supervisor` role vs. `is_supervisor` field:**
    *   The `UserModel` currently allows `'supervisor'` as a role in `validationRules`.
    *   You want roles to be `admin`, `user`, `guest`, and to use a separate field (which I've named `is_supervisor`) to denote if a user is a supervisor.
    *   Should we remove `'supervisor'` from the list of valid roles in `$validationRules['role']` and rely solely on the `is_supervisor` boolean field? Or can a user have the role `'user'` but also have `is_supervisor = true`? This will affect how we query for supervisors later. For now, in the suggested code, I've updated the role validation to `'in_list[admin,user,guest]'`.

Once you clarify these points, we can move on to the proposal, activity, and reminder functionalities.

What are your thoughts on these initial changes to the `UserModel`? And could you please clarify the points about `report_to_id` and the `supervisor` role?
