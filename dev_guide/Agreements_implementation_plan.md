```

### Files to Reference

## Database Considerations

### Schema Verification
- Verify activities_agreements table matches model allowedFields
- Ensure JSON fields are properly configured
- Check for any missing fields needed for implementation

### Potential Schema Updates
If additional fields are needed:
```sql
-- Add fields if missing (check current schema first)
ALTER TABLE activities_agreements 
ADD COLUMN location VARCHAR(255) AFTER remarks,
ADD COLUMN gps_coordinates VARCHAR(255) AFTER location,
ADD COLUMN terms TEXT AFTER gps_coordinates,
ADD COLUMN conditions TEXT AFTER terms,
ADD COLUMN signing_sheet_filepath VARCHAR(500) AFTER conditions;
```

### Model Updates
Update ActivitiesAgreementsModel allowedFields if new fields are added:
```php
protected $allowedFields = [
    'activity_id', 'title', 'description', 'agreement_type',
    'parties', 'effective_date', 'expiry_date', 'status',
    'attachments', 'remarks', 'location', 'gps_coordinates',
    'terms', 'conditions', 'signing_sheet_filepath',
    'is_deleted', 'created_by', 'updated_by', 'deleted_by'
];
```

## Validation Rules

### Form Validation
```php
$validationRules = [
    'title' => 'required|max_length[255]',
    'description' => 'permit_empty',
    'agreement_type' => 'permit_empty|max_length[100]',
    'effective_date' => 'required|valid_date',
    'expiry_date' => 'permit_empty|valid_date',
    'status' => 'permit_empty|in_list[draft,active,expired,terminated,archived]',
    'location' => 'permit_empty|max_length[255]',
    'gps_coordinates' => 'permit_empty|max_length[255]',
    'terms' => 'permit_empty',
    'conditions' => 'permit_empty',
    'remarks' => 'permit_empty',
    'agreement_documents' => 'permit_empty|uploaded[agreement_documents]|max_size[agreement_documents,5120]',
    'signing_sheet' => 'permit_empty|uploaded[signing_sheet]|max_size[signing_sheet,5120]'
];
```

## Implementation Status & Issues Encountered

### ✅ Completed Phases

#### Phase 1: Controller Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Added `saveAgreementImplementation()` method to ActivitiesController
- ✅ Added 'agreements' case to `saveImplementation()` method
- ✅ Implemented validation rules for agreement fields
- ✅ Added JSON field processing for parties and attachments
- ✅ Implemented file upload handling for agreement documents

#### Phase 2: View Implementation ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Created `agreements_implementation.php` form view
- ✅ Updated `agreements_details.php` to align with database schema
- ✅ Implemented dynamic parties management interface
- ✅ Added file upload sections with validation
- ✅ Integrated JavaScript for add/remove functionality

#### Phase 3: File Management ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Added `agreement_attachments` directory to upload structure
- ✅ Implemented secure file storage and validation
- ✅ Added download functionality for existing files

### 🚨 Critical Issue Discovered & Resolved

#### Issue: Form Data Not Pre-populating
**Problem**: When accessing `/activities/{id}/implement` for agreement activities, the form appeared empty even when implementation data existed in the database.

**Root Cause**: The `implement()` method in `ActivitiesController.php` was missing the case to fetch existing agreement implementation data. While the method handled other activity types (documents, trainings, inputs, infrastructures, outputs, meetings), it lacked the agreements case.

**Impact**:
- Users couldn't edit existing agreement implementations
- Form appeared empty despite having saved data
- Poor user experience and potential data loss

**Solution Applied**:
```php
// Added to implement() method around line 586
} elseif ($activity['type'] === 'agreements') {
    $implementationData = $this->activitiesAgreementsModel
        ->where('activity_id', $activity['id'])
        ->first();

    // ActivitiesAgreementsModel automatically decodes JSON fields via afterFind callback
    // No manual JSON decoding needed
}
```

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED - Form now properly pre-populates with existing data

### 🔄 Database Schema Adjustments Made

During implementation, discovered that the `activities_agreements` table has a more limited schema than initially planned. Removed the following fields from implementation:
- `location` - Not present in current schema
- `gps_coordinates` - Not present in current schema
- `terms` - Not present in current schema
- `conditions` - Not present in current schema
- `signing_sheet_filepath` - Not present in current schema

**Current Working Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE activities_agreements (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    activity_id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    agreement_type VARCHAR(100),
    parties LONGTEXT, -- JSON field
    effective_date DATE,
    expiry_date DATE,
    status ENUM('draft','active','expired','terminated','archived') DEFAULT 'draft',
    attachments LONGTEXT, -- JSON field
    remarks TEXT,
    -- Standard audit fields
    is_deleted TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME,
    deleted_at DATETIME,
    created_by INT,
    updated_by INT,
    deleted_by INT
);
```

### 📋 Implementation Lessons Learned

1. **Always Check All Controller Methods**: When implementing new activity types, ensure ALL relevant controller methods include the new type:
   - `implement()` - for fetching existing data
   - `saveImplementation()` - for saving data
   - `show()` - for displaying details

2. **Verify Database Schema**: Always verify actual database schema matches planned schema before implementation

3. **Test Data Flow**: Test the complete data flow from form → controller → database → form to ensure data persistence works correctly

- ✅ Complete form interface for creating/editing agreements
- ✅ Dynamic parties management
