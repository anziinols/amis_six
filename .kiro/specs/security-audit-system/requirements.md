# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a comprehensive security audit system for the AMIS Five agricultural management application. The system will systematically identify, assess, and mitigate common CodeIgniter 4 security vulnerabilities including SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, file upload vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, SSRF, insecure configurations, and deserialization attacks. This security audit system will provide automated scanning capabilities, manual verification tasks, and remediation guidance to ensure the application meets production security standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to perform automated SQL injection vulnerability scans, so that I can identify and fix potential database security weaknesses before they are exploited.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the security audit system scans database queries THEN it SHALL identify all raw SQL queries that lack proper sanitization
2. WHEN the system detects potential SQL injection points THEN it SHALL generate a detailed report with file locations and vulnerable code snippets
3. WHEN scanning form inputs THEN the system SHALL verify that all user inputs are properly validated and escaped
4. IF raw SQL queries are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations to convert them to Query Builder patterns
5. WHEN the scan completes THEN the system SHALL verify that db_debug is set to FALSE in production configuration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want to detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in user inputs and outputs, so that I can prevent malicious script injection attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans view files THEN it SHALL identify all user data output points that lack proper escaping
2. WHEN analyzing form inputs THEN the system SHALL verify XSS filtering is enabled and properly configured
3. WHEN the audit runs THEN it SHALL test for both reflected and stored XSS vulnerabilities in all user input fields
4. IF unescaped output is detected THEN the system SHALL recommend specific esc() function implementations
5. WHEN scanning JavaScript in views THEN the system SHALL flag any unfiltered user data being rendered in scripts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify CSRF protection implementation across all forms, so that I can prevent unauthorized state-changing requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans form elements THEN it SHALL verify that all state-changing forms include CSRF tokens
2. WHEN analyzing POST/PUT/DELETE routes THEN the system SHALL confirm CSRF validation is enabled
3. WHEN checking configuration THEN the system SHALL verify $csrfProtection is enabled in Security.php
4. IF forms lack CSRF protection THEN the system SHALL provide specific implementation guidance
5. WHEN the audit completes THEN it SHALL generate a report of all forms and their CSRF protection status

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to audit file upload security configurations, so that I can prevent malicious file uploads and remote code execution attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans upload functionality THEN it SHALL verify file type restrictions are properly implemented
2. WHEN analyzing upload directories THEN it SHALL check that file permissions are set to 775 or more restrictive
3. WHEN reviewing upload code THEN the system SHALL ensure files are stored outside the webroot when possible
4. IF executable file types are allowed THEN the system SHALL flag this as a critical security risk
5. WHEN the scan runs THEN it SHALL verify MIME type validation is implemented for all file uploads

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want to detect privilege escalation vulnerabilities in user access controls, so that I can prevent unauthorized permission increases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system audits user roles THEN it SHALL verify the principle of least privilege is enforced
2. WHEN analyzing authentication logic THEN it SHALL check for proper session management and role validation
3. WHEN scanning user management functions THEN the system SHALL identify any hardcoded credentials or weak authentication
4. IF privilege escalation risks are found THEN the system SHALL recommend CodeIgniter Shield implementation
5. WHEN the audit runs THEN it SHALL verify all administrative functions require proper authorization checks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities, so that I can prevent unauthorized internal and external requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans API endpoints THEN it SHALL identify functions that make HTTP requests with user-supplied URLs
2. WHEN analyzing URL handling code THEN it SHALL verify proper URL validation and sanitization
3. WHEN checking external integrations THEN the system SHALL ensure allowlists are implemented for permitted domains
4. IF SSRF vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific mitigation recommendations
5. WHEN the scan completes THEN it SHALL generate a report of all external request functionality and their security status

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to audit file permissions and configuration security, so that I can prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system checks file permissions THEN it SHALL verify index.php is set to 644 or more restrictive
2. WHEN scanning configuration files THEN it SHALL ensure .env files are properly protected with .htaccess
3. WHEN analyzing directory permissions THEN the system SHALL flag any directories with 777 permissions as security risks
4. IF sensitive files are exposed THEN the system SHALL provide specific .htaccess protection recommendations
5. WHEN the audit runs THEN it SHALL verify the application is running in production mode with error reporting disabled

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want to scan for insecure deserialization vulnerabilities, so that I can prevent code execution through untrusted data processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans code for serialization functions THEN it SHALL identify all uses of unserialize(), serialize(), and related functions
2. WHEN analyzing data processing THEN it SHALL verify that only trusted data sources are deserialized
3. WHEN checking third-party libraries THEN the system SHALL flag any known vulnerable deserialization implementations
4. IF insecure deserialization is found THEN the system SHALL recommend safe alternatives like JSON processing
5. WHEN the scan completes THEN it SHALL provide a comprehensive report of all serialization/deserialization usage

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to generate comprehensive security audit reports, so that I can track remediation progress and demonstrate compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a security audit completes THEN the system SHALL generate a detailed PDF report with all findings
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are identified THEN the report SHALL include severity ratings, affected files, and remediation steps
3. WHEN the report is generated THEN it SHALL include executive summary, technical details, and action items
4. IF critical vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL send immediate email notifications to administrators
5. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL maintain a history of audit results and remediation status

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want access to automated remediation tools, so that I can quickly fix identified security vulnerabilities with guided assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN vulnerabilities are identified THEN the system SHALL provide specific code examples for fixes
2. WHEN remediation is needed THEN the system SHALL offer automated code generation for common security patterns
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL allow re-scanning to verify remediation effectiveness
4. IF multiple similar vulnerabilities exist THEN the system SHALL provide batch remediation options
5. WHEN remediation completes THEN the system SHALL update the security status and generate confirmation reports
